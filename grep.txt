Using grep:-
---------------
grep is a command which uses regular expression to isolate matching data. The basic usage of grep is to provide a regular expression and a file on which the regular expression should be matched.
Syntax:-
 grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]

Note:- because regular expression often contain shell metacharacters such as $ , * and others, it is recommended practice to use single quotes (') to encapsulate the regular expression on the command line.
grep can be used in conjunction with other command using a | 
examples:-
	grep 'cat$' /usr/share/dict/words
	who | grep ^student
grep Options:-
-------------------
grep has many useful options for adjusting how it uses the provided regular expression with data:

Option		Function
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-i		Use the regular expression provided; however do not enforce case sensitivity
-v		Only display lines that do not contain matches to the regular expression
-r 		Search for data matching the regular expression recursively to a group of files or dirs
-A  <Number>	Display <Number> of lines afterthe regular expression match
-B <Number>	Display <Number> of line before the regular expression match
-e 		with multiple -e options used, multiple regular exprpessions can be supplied and will be used with a logical OR


Examples:-
1. Search for a word called 'system' in practice.txt
   grep -w system practice.txt
2. Search for the lines that start with work 'system'
   grep -w ^system practice.txt
3. Search for lines that ends with given word 'sandya'
   grep -w "sandya$" practice1.txt
Inverting the pattern match : You can display the lines that are not matched with the specified search sting pattern using the -v option
4. grep -i -w -n  -v '^abc$1234'  practice1.txt
Display the file names that matches the pattern : We can just display the files that contains the given string/pattern.
5.grep  -l sandya  *.txt
6.print only a count of the lines that match a pattern
who | grep -w ^vijai | wc -l
or
who | grep -w -c  ^vijai
wehre -c : count
7.Specify expression with -e option. Can use multiple times
who | grep -e muktha -e vijai
8.Print only directories on the screen
ls -l | grep ^d
